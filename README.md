# Simulated Diabetes Assessment Dataset
This dataset serves as a preliminary exploration into data analysis and visualization techniques. It has been randomly generated to simulate a diabetes classification scenario. Please note that this dataset is entirely synthetic and is not based on real medical data.

## Dataset Description
- The dataset contains information on various individuals, encompassing features commonly associated with diabetes diagnosis. These features include:
- ID: A unique identifier assigned to each individual.
- Age: The age of the individual.
- Gender: The gender of the individual.
- BMI: The Body Mass Index, which relates weight and height.
- Glucose: Blood glucose level, a crucial indicator in diabetes diagnosis.
- Insulin: Insulin levels in the body.
- HbA1c: Hemoglobin A1c level, another vital parameter for diabetes assessment.
- FamilyHistory: Whether the individual has a family history of diabetes.
- Diabetes: The target variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes.

## Characteristics of the Dataset
+ Duplicates: To introduce variability, a small number of duplicate entries have been intentionally inserted.
+ Outliers: Outliers have been introduced in ‘Glucose’ and ‘Insulin’ columns to mimic potential data anomalies.
+ Missing Values: A subset of the dataset contains missing values, as is common in real-world data.
+ Random Generation: This dataset has been randomly generated for educational purposes and does not reflect real patient data.
